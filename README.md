# Game Blog

A place to put some of a writing about games, and something to get me back into building javascript projects after the holidays.

## Running the site

If you want to run this yourself for some reason:

Run `npm install` then start the server with `npm start`.

You can then run the cypress tests through the test runner with `npx cypress open`. Make sure the server is running before doing this (in a different terminal or window usually).

##

Built using Express, and Pug as a templating engine.
Tests use Mocha, Chai, and chai-http.
