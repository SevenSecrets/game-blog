# Game Blog

A place to put some of a writing about games, and something to get me back into building javascript projects after the holidays.

### Running the site

If you want to run this yourself for some reason:

Run ```npm install``` then make sure everything is okay by running the tests with ```npm test```.
 
Start the server with ```npm start```.



Built using Express, and Pug as a templating engine.
Tests use Mocha, Chai, and chai-http.
